A variance is required when an application has submitted a proposed project to the Department of Permitting Services and it is determined that the construction, alteration or extension does not conform to the development standards (in the zoning ordinance) for the zone in which the subject property is located.  A variance may be required in any zone and includes accessory structures as well as primary buildings or dwellings.
