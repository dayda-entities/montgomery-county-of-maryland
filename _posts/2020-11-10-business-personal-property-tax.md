This dataset contains the mailing address of all businesses that operate in Montgomery County that have filed with the Maryland State Department of Assessment and Taxation. The information displayed in this dataset is based on a business being billed for their business personal property tax.  Businesses are billed for this tax annually based on their filing date.  The County sends out these tax bills monthly throughout the year.   As such, this dataset which is updated annually, is a snapshot of the annual billing cycle as of October 2020.  The following will affect the number of records in this dataset for this levy year:
•           The filing extension to July 15, 2020.
•           Tax Property Article, 7-245 which includes an exemption from business personal property assessment for business entities with assets having a total cost of less than $2,500.
