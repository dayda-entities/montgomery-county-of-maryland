The Office of Consumer Protection (OCP) licenses builders or anyone acting in the capacity of a building contractor who constructs new homes in Montgomery County. This data consists of all active new home builder license holders. OCP does not license home improvement (ex. repair, remodeling, partial replacement, addition, or modernization, of existing structure) contractors; these contractors are licensed by Maryland Home Improvement Commission.  The license information is deemed to be reliable, but we cannot guarantee the accuracy and completeness of the information. Any information that is shown to be inaccurate will be corrected if brought to the attention of OCP.  Data Update Frequency : Daily
