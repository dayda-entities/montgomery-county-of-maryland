The purpose of this Spending Disclosure FY11 dataset is to allow the public to search and view summary information on payments made to recipients (referred to as suppliers) that received $25,000 or more in a fiscal year. Note that salary and benefit payments to employees, pension payments to retirees, and any information that is confidential under State or Federal law is excluded from disclosure.
