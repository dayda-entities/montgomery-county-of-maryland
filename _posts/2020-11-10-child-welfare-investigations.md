This dataset shows the monthly count of new and completed investigations conducted by Child Welfare Services, broken down by type and outcome. The dataset includes statistics for both traditional Investigation Responses and for Alternative Responses. An Alternative Response is intended to increase engagement and service usage through a collaborative partnership with families in cases where there is no Child Protective Services history and the referral suggests low risk of harm to the child. A completed Investigation Response can have one of three outcomes: (1) allegation indicated -- credible evidence found which has not been satisfactorily refuted; (2) allegation ruled out – credible evidence found that the abuse did not occur; and (3) allegation unsubstantiated – insufficient evidence found to support a finding of indicated or ruled out abuse. This dataset is updated quarterly.
