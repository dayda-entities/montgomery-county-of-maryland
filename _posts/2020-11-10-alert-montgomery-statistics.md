This dataset offers a monthly snapshot of messages sent through the Alert Montgomery system. Alert Montgomery provides text, email, and/or voice alerts on weather, traffic, and other emergencies. Additionally, other departments use the system to update residents on facility closures. The data is broken out into types of messages, number of contacts receiving messages, and increase / decrease of alert subscribers.
