A permit is required to install a retaining wall if the height of the wall measured from the bottom of the footing to the top of the wall is over 48 inches unless supporting a surcharge.  A permit application for a retaining wall installed on the private property line must be accompanied by a letter of approval from the adjacent property owner. Occasionally, lot conditions require approvals from other agencies such as easement holders, or homeowner associations. Any dispute as to whether a Retaining Wall has extended into a neighborâ€™s property or questions about the location of property lines is a legal matter to be resolved by the property owners. Any Retaining Wall installed within the County right of way will not be permitted and will be required to be removed
