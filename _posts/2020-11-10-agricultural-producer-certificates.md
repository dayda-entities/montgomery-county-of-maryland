A Certified Agricultural Producer, or representative thereof, is an individual who wishes to sell regionally-grown products in the public right-of-way.  A Certified Agricultural Producer, or representative thereof, may sell only fresh fruits, vegetables, herbs, cut flowers, small trees, or plants, which he or she has produced. A Certified Agricultural Producer may also sell non-potentially-hazardous prepackaged goods (including eggs), with the approval of the Licensure and Regulatory Services Section of the Department of Health and Human Services.  The dataset contains information for active Agricultural Producer certificates (not voided, not Stop Work Order).
