A permit is required to install any type of fence in Montgomery County. Replacement of an existing fence, ORIGINALLY INSTALLED WITH A FENCE PERMIT, with the same kind of fence in the same location at the same height, does not require a fence permit. If an existing fence was not installed with a fence permit, the replacement fence must have a fence permit.
