This dataset contains information on ‘Tree Montgomery’ which is a new program to plant shade trees for free. Please note that only planted and completed trees are included. The Montgomery County Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) is looking for places to plant, especially in yards of single family homes, parking lots, and multi-family communities. We’re also targeting areas where there is a lot of development, little tree canopy, or a real need for shade. The County will install shade trees and give them some after care; all for free. When installed, the trees will be 10 to 12 feet tall and will eventually be more than 50 feet tall, providing you with decades of shade. Funding for ‘Tree Montgomery’ is provided through the Tree Canopy Law.
