MCDC is primarily responsible for the intake and law enforcement processing of adult male and female offenders arrested in Montgomery County and has a facility capacity to accommodate approximately 200 inmates. Over 13,000 offenders annually arrive at MCDC’s Central Processing Unit (CPU).  This dataset captures the monthly count of those processed per Shift at our Central Processing Unit located at Montgomery County Detention Services (MCDC). There are total of three shifts (Shift 2: 6:30am-3pm, Shift 3: 2:30pm-11pm, Shift 1: 10:30pm-7am)- half hour overlap is shift change/roll call. The dataset further identifies the data as either “Criminal” or “Traffic.”
