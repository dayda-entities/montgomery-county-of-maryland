The Levy Year 2012 real property tax rate dataset reflects all the rates per $100 set each year by the County Council.  These rates are applied to the assessed value of the real property to derive the applicable ad valorem tax.  The fully phased-in assessed value equals the full cash value of the property. The real property tax is levied annually on all taxable land and improvements.  The tax rate schedule is updated annually. A detailed tax rate schedule for all tax classes is available by clicking on “Tax Rates” under the link for “County Taxes” when visiting the County website at www.montgomerycountymd.gov/finance or by calling 311 (240-777-0311).

Update Frequency:  Annually
