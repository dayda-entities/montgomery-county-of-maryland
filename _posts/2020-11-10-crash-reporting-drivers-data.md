This dataset provides information on motor vehicle operators (drivers) involved in traffic collisions occurring on county and local roadways. The dataset reports details of all traffic collisions occurring on county and local roadways within Montgomery County, as collected via the Automated Crash Reporting System (ACRS) of the Maryland State Police, and reported by the Montgomery County Police, Gaithersburg Police, Rockville Police, or the Maryland-National Capital Park Police.  This dataset shows each collision data recorded and the drivers involved.

Please note that these collision reports are based on preliminary information supplied to the Police Department by the reporting parties. Therefore, the collision data available on this web page may reflect:
 
-Information not yet verified by further investigation
-Information that may include verified and unverified collision data
-Preliminary collision classifications may be changed at a later date based upon further investigation
-Information may include mechanical or human error
