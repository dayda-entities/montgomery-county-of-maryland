This dataset contains data for Use and Occupancy Certificates including status and work performed.  A Use & Occupancy Certificate (U&O) is required before a building or space may be occupied. It is issued after the building or space has passed final inspections for building, electrical and mechanical and fire disciplines.  The purpose of this certificate is to document that the use is permitted, and that all applicable safety code and health code requirements have been met.  Each different use in a building must have a separate Use and Occupancy certificate.
