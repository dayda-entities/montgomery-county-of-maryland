A map of the boundaries of all approved master plans and current plans that are in the process of attaining community input and eventual County Council consideration. Master Plans are comprehensive amendments to the General Plan for Montgomery County that provide detailed and specific land use and zoning recommendations for specific areas of the County. They also address transportation, the natural environment, urban design, historic resources, public facilities, and implementation techniques.  Additional information on Master Plans can be found at http://www.montgomeryplanning.org/community/.
 
Each listed plan includes links to more information on the master plan and a PDF copy of the adopted planning staff report or draft report. Source: M-NCPPC Planning.
