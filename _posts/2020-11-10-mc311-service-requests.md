Information on all MC311 Service Requests received (via email or phone) since July 1, 2012.  This data is updated daily.
The PIO’s business requirement includes adding the following data elements to the new and enhanced open data site being proposed by DTS.  This data is derived from requests for service which originate in the CSC, from the County’s web portal, and via “walk-ins” from county departments including but not limited to DHCA.
•	SLA – to indicate the number of days in county business days the department has to fulfill the request.  County business days must exclude weekends, county holidays and days when the county is closed due to inclement weather (snow days, etc) per CountyStat’s business requirement.  This field has been published in the existing MC311 Service Requests dataset with the field name ‘Attached Solution SLA Days’.
•	+/- SLA –to indicate the number of days a service request is over or under SLA as is currently measured by CountyStat. The following 4 fields will be added to fulfill this line item
	# of days open – Number of County Business days the Service Request has been opened.
	Within SLA Window? - To indicate the number of days a service request is over or under SLA as is currently measured by CountyStat.
	SLA Yes – Number of days to fulfill the service request  is under the SLA window.
	SLA No -– Number of days to fulfill the service request  is over the SLA window.
