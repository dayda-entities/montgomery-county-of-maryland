Executive Regulation 05-17 provides a methodology for designating certain multifamily rental housing units as "Troubled Properties" These "Troubled Properties" are subject to at least annual housing code inspections and must develop and implement a corrective action plan. This dataset provides housing code inspection results along with scores for both severity and quantity of violations.
