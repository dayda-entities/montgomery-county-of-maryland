On May 3, 2011 Montgomery County passed legislation (Bill 8-11) that places a five-cent charge on each paper or plastic carryout bag provided by retail establishments in the County to customers at the point of sale, pickup or delivery. Retailers retain 1 cent of each 5 cents for the bags they sell a customer.Â  This dataset represents information that has been captured since this law went into effect. Update Frequency - Monthly
