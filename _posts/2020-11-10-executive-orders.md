The authority granted to the County Executive by law to take a certain specific action or the means by which the County Executive exercises his general executive powers. An order generally directs a specific single action rather than establishing rules and standards. Examples of the use of Executive Orders granted by local law include the specific authority of the County Executive under Section 2A-17 of the County Code to issue traffic orders which direct the establishment of stop signs, fire lanes, no parking, etc., at particular designated locations. Examples of Executive Orders arising from his general authority under the Charter of Montgomery County include orders to acquire specific parcels of land for rights-of-way, to direct condemnation by the County Attorney, and to authorize the sale of surplus County property.
