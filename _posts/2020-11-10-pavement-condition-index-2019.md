Pavement Condition Index is provided by the Department of Transportation for analyzing the conditions of the pavement for all 5,200 lane miles of roadways within the County. Pavement Condition Index or PCI is a numerical expression between 0-100 numerically representing the pavements condition. For example, a PCI of 30 is considered as “poor” whereas a PCI rating of 80 indicates pavement in very good condition.

The pavements’ numerical PCI score is developed through an analysis of nineteen (19) discrete pavement distresses (cracking, pot holes, environmental distress, utility cuts, etc.) and ranges from 1-100 with 1 being an absolute failure and 100 representing perfect conditions. This dataset is updated Bi-annually.
