A mapped dataset and layer of individual sites and districts that the County has designated as historic, or which have been listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The National Register is the federal list of buildings, districts, and other objects significant to the nationâ€™s history or architecture. For more information, see http://www.nps.gov/nr/faq.htm#nr. The Master Plan for Historic Preservation is the County's preservation planning document that includes the list of all county-designated historic sites and districts. Sites and districts which have been added to the Master Plan have been found to be of special historic or architectural significance and receive protection under the Historic Preservation Ordinance, Chapter 24A of the County Code. For more information, see http://montgomeryplanning.org/historic/research.shtm. For field descriptions, see attachment on the About tab. Source: M-NCPPC Planning
